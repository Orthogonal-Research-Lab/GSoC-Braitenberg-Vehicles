# Intro to Embodied Cognition
Embodied Cognition has come up as a theme in our Braitenber Vehicle Project. This folder will house a collection of relevant resources for Embodied Cognition (EC)

A general overview: [Embodied Cognition via Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/):

- In general, dominant views in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science have considered the body as peripheral to understanding the nature of mind and cognition. Proponents of embodied cognitive science view this as a serious mistake. Sometimes the nature of the dependence of cognition on the body is quite unexpected, and suggests new ways of conceptualizing and exploring the mechanics of cognitive processing.

- Relatively recent work on the embodiment of cognition provides much food for thought for empirically-informed philosophers of mind. This is in part because of the rich range of phenomena that embodied cognitive science has studied. But it is also in part because those phenomena are often thought to challenge dominant views of the mind, such as the computational and representational theories of mind, at the heart of traditional cognitive science. And they have sometimes been taken to undermine standard positions in the philosophy of mind, such as the idea that the mind is identical to, or even realized in, the brain.

["Radical Embodied Cognitive Science of Human Behavior: Skill Acquisition, Expertise and Talent Development" FrontiersIn - Resaerch Topic & Article Collection](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/9049/radical-embodied-cognitive-science-of-human-behavior-skill-acquisition-expertise-and-talent-developm#overview)

- Radical embodied cognitive science as an approach emphasizes the relationship between body and the environment or ecosystem. Often perceived as being relevant to motor behavior and other "lower" cognitive functions, it is nevertheless an approach that also addresses the full range of psychosocial activity, including the experience, mindset, interactions or other "higher" functions. The Research Topic will bring together examples of theoretical and empirical research which illustrate how radical embodied cognitive science casts new light on questions of traditionally "higher" functions, or directly challenges traditional conceptualizations of those functions. 





[Embodied Cognition With and Without Mental Representations: The Case of Embodied Choices in Sports](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01825/full)
- "In this conceptual analysis contribution to the special issue on radical embodied cognition, we discuss how embodied cognition can exist with and without representations. We explore this concept through the lens of judgment and decision-making in sports (JDMS). Embodied cognition has featured in many investigations of human behavior, but no single approach has emerged. Indeed, the very definitions of the concepts “embodiment” and “cognition” lack consensus, and consequently the degree of “radicalism” is not universally defined, either. In this paper, we address JDMS not from a rigid theoretical perspective but from two embodied cognition approaches: one that assumes there is mediation between the athlete and the environment through mental representation, and another that assumes direct contact between the athlete and the environment and thus no need for mental representation. Importantly, our aim was not to arrive at a theoretical consensus or set up a competition between approaches but rather to provide a legitimate scientific discussion about how to explain empirical results in JDMS from contrasting perspectives within embodied cognition."
