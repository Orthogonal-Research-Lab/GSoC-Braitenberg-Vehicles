Context
-------
Before starting to commit in the main project, I was looking at various possibilities of writing a brain/cognitive simulation with GUI. 

Decision
--------
Pick TornadoFX and Kotlin as main simulation framework.

Rationalization
---------------
With lots of possibilities around, the 2nd place winning one being Simbrain, 
TornadoFX and Kotlin seemed to be the most modern and, hence, robust and extendable option.
Furthermore, reduction of the amount and increase of the readability of code, which the framework provides, are especially important for an open-source project.
