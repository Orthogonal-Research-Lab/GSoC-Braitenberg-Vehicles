Context
-------
After a while writing the project code, I've realized that it needs constant and probably heavyweight rendering.

Decision
--------
Leave with JavaFX/TornadoFX as constant rendering/animation framework.

Rationalization
---------------
Although there are probably better frameworks/engines (e.g. Unity, OpenGL), configuring and learning to use them would probably take time I don't have.
JavaFX seems to be a nice opportunity with relatively little to learn.
