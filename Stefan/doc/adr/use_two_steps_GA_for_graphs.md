Context
-------
In our approach, brains = weighted neural networks *with different amount of nodes* should be developed. 

Decision
--------
Use adjacency matrixes in the first step and grammar rules yielded from the first step in the second step for networks representation.

Rationalization
---------------
To be able to develop brains with many nodes scalably and unevenly, the grammar approach to building the graphs was picked, as the best known one.
However, for this approach there are some grammar patterns to exist beforehand, which we then take from the "first step"
of algorithm, running GA with adjacency matrices to figure out the most finesse brain patterns.
