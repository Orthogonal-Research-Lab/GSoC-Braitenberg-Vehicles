[c302](opensourcebrain.org/projects/c302) is an [OpenWorm Foundation project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNTwraEPp0M) focused on simulating all neuronal activity in the _C. elegans_ connectome. Combined with information about the developmental emergence of this connectome, we can simulate the embryonic activity (and even proto-behaviors) of a connectome. This can also be used to validate the Braitenberg vehicle models.
